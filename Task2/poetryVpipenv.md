# Differences
- both are python virtual environments and dependency management tools
- poetry on top of that also provides package management functions (packaging and publishing)
- pipenv is not well maintained (in 2019 it went without a single release)
- poetry is by some articles considered to be the `new era`
- pipenv has slower locking times (when adding, updating or removing packages)
